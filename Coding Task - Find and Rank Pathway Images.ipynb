    "1. Write a function get_images() that (i) Takes in a user query, (ii) Constructs a Google Images URL for the query, (iii) Sends a GET request to the URL, and (iv) Returns the response text as metadata for downstream processing. Additionally, this function attempts to (a) Get the image URLs from the metadata, (b) Send a GET request to each URL, and (c) download these images to a local directory\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a function score_image_quality() that (i) Take the metadata returned by the API for each image and (ii) Returns a quality score based on certain criteria. In this case, I used the file size (less than 10MB) and image resolution (greater than 1080p) as preliminary criteria to rank images worth showing in the Target Detail page.\n",

    "Finally, I save all the image URLs along with their corresponding quality scores in a dataframe and sort it based on the scores."
